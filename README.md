# data_cleaning
> [!NOTE]
Purpose of this code is to clean BLS data. Important parameters are OCODE (Occupational Employment Codes) and FIPS (localities). <br />
<br />Rather than inputting one file by one, or chucking multiple relative paths into a list, this program directly takes all .JSON files within a designated folder and clean.<br />
<br />Very efficient when you have multiple .JSON files to clean.<br />
